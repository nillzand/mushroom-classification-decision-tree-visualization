# mushroom-classification-decision-tree-visualization
Train a decision tree classifier on the mushroom dataset to predict edibility. The code removes constant columns and encodes categorical features. It also provides code to split the dataset, train the model, and evaluate accuracy. Visualize the decision tree using Graphviz.
